# hello-world
This is my personal hello-world repository. It contains ideas for future projects and helps me learning about git/hub and software developement

Hello world, my name is Nils and I'd like to learn how to use Git in order to start my first android-app development project. I start learning everything with a MOOC which works me through the creation of a simple wheather app. I hope to be able to finish quickly and then create a learning app.

Cheers!
